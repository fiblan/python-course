    "There are many reasons for using bastion hosts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- security access eg in cloud environment\n",
    "- vpn eg via Windows hosts\n",
    "  \n",
    "The latter case is not interesting as [ansible doesn't support windows as a client platform](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/os_guide/windows_faq.html#does-ansible-work-with-windows-xp-or-server-2003).\n",
    "\n",
    "A standard approach is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- to have an ssh server or a proxy installed on the bastion\n",
    "- connecto the bastion to the remote network (eg. via vpn)\n",
    "- configure ssh options in ansible to connect through the bastion\n",
    "  \n",
    "We'll do this via two configuration files:\n",
    "\n",
    "- a standard `ssh_config` where we put the \"passthru\" configuration\n",
    "- a simple `ansible.cfg` referencing `ssh_config`\n",
    "  \n",
    "This approach allows us:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. to test the standard ssh connection thru the bastion without messing with ansible\n",
    "2. keep `ansible.cfg` simple in case we want to reuse them from the intranet (Eg. without traversing the bastion)\n",
